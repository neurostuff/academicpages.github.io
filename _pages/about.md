Neurostuff is a blog dedicated to showcasing the latest developments in the open neuroscience world. It highlights some cool analyses and visualizations that you can do in the open-neuro ecosystem. We hope that this serves as inspiration to people doing their own analyses, as well as encouragement to new users who'd like to get involved in this community.

Currently this website focuses on the project [MNE-python](https://martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html), though we hope that it will incorporate the activity of other packages soon.
